      <h1>Privacy Policy for Smart Sail</h1>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 19th Aug 2024</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Smart Sail ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your
        privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and
        safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("the
        App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of your
        information in accordance with this policy.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>User Account Information:</strong> When you create an account
          in the App, we collect and store information provided by you (stored
          securely using Amazon Cognito), including:
          <ul>
            <li>User ID</li>
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Email address</li>
            <li>Phone number</li>
            <li>Password</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Location Data:</strong> We collect location data associated
          with your sailing activities and store it using a token representing
          your user account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sail, Boat, and Device Data:</strong> We store data related to
          sails, boats, and smart sail devices owned by you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Crash Data:</strong> In the event of a crash or error within
          the App, we collect data related to your phone, including:
          <ul>

            <li>Current time zone</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>User-Directed Sharing:</strong> You may choose to share your
          race and sail data with other users within the App. This is entirely
          at your discretion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We use third-party
          services, such as Amazon Cognito for user authentication and Sentry.io
          for crash reporting. These service providers are responsible for the
          storage and security of the data they collect on our behalf.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>User Rights:</strong> You have the right to request the deletion
        of any of your data, including user credentials, sail, device, boat,
        race, and location data, access logs, and crash reports. To do so,
        please contact us with proof of ownership of the account. We will
        process your request and delete your data from our system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data backups are retained for a period of 1 week. After this period,
        data potentially containing your information will be automatically
        deleted.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take the security of your data seriously and have implemented
        measures to safeguard it. However, please be aware that no security
        system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of
        your data and cannot be held responsible for any unauthorized access,
        hacking, or other security breaches. Your use of the App is at your own
        risk.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Internet Risks</h2>
      <p>
        While we strive to protect your data, using the Internet to transmit
        information inherently carries risks. We are not responsible for the
        security or privacy of data while it is being transmitted over the
        Internet.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes
        in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
        We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy
        Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date above.
      </p>
