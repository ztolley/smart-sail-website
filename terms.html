                  11.1 The Company employs professional carriers. Nevertheless, the Buyer
                  must examine Goods on arrival and the Buyer must indicate on the
                  professional carrier’s delivery note (when signing to accept delivery of
                  the Goods) if the external packaging is, or appears to be, damaged. The
                  Company will refund the full purchase price including (as may be
                  applicable) shipping/ postage and packing of any Goods which are
                  delivered in a damaged or faulty condition or which develops a fault
                  within 3 months from delivery (other than due to normal wear and tear,
                  failure to follow instructions or misuse).
                </p>
                <p>
                  11.2 Alternatively, at the Buyer’s option, the Company will replace the
                  item with the same or a similar product (subject to stock availability).
                </p>
                <p>
                  11.3 If a product is damaged or faulty, please notify the Company in
                  writing (by email or post) as soon as possible but in any event within
                  14 working days of receipt of the Goods or of the fault developing

                <p>
                  11.4 The Buyer must return the Goods to the Company in accordance with
                  the procedure set out in clause 7.1 to 7.4 above (although the Company
                  may wish to arrange for the collection of the Goods at its cost and will
                  inform the Buyer accordingly when it notifies the Company that it wishes

                  11.5 Sometimes the product specifications from the manufacturer may
                  change, in which case, if the Buyer requests a replacement, the Company
                  will do its best to offer the Buyer a substitute of the same or better
                  quality at the same price. If the Buyer is not happy with the
                  replacement, it can return it in accordance with the Company’s returns
                  policy as outlined above under clause 7.

                  from the Buyer in the event that the item is found to have suffered
                  damage after delivery to the Buyer or has been misused or used other

                <p>
                  12.1 The Company warrants to the Buyer that the goods are to be free of
                  defects in materials and workmanship for the Warranty Period (as defined
                  below), subject to the remaining provisions of this clause 12 and to the
                  other provisions of these conditions (including but not limited to the
                  limitation and exclusion of liability provisions in clause 13 below). In
                  the case of such a defect, the Company will either repair or replace the
                  Goods concerned but such obligation to repair or replace is the limit of
                  the Company’s liability under this warranty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  12.2 The Warranty Period will be 5 years from date of purchase in
                  respect of hardware and 2 years from date of purchase of deckware, in
                  the case of the ‘Deckvest’ product the 2 year period can be extended to
                  5 years by the Buyer registering the purchase of the ‘Deckvest ‘product
                  on the Company’s website within 30 days of purchase. These warranty
                  periods are reduced to 1 year from date of purchase for any Goods used
                  (i) in professional or semi-professional racing, (ii) for military
                  purposes (iii) Commercial/Industrial or (iv) outside of leisure sailing.
                  For the avoidance of doubt, ‘Leisure Sailing’ is where the customer
                  exclusively uses their boat or watercraft purely for pleasure and as a
                  hobby, ‘Commercial/Industrial’ operates a business that offers services
                  or products to users and ‘Professional Marine’ uses their boat or
                  watercraft as a business, employs paid crew, spends most of the year
                  under sail or power, enters multiple regattas with a paid or
                  professional crew, offers passages or holidays to paying guests.

                  commissioning and use of the Goods;

                <p>
                  12.7 The Buyer should note that certain environmental elements such as
                  salt, sand, moisture and chemicals may considerably accelerate wear of
                  certain of the Goods. In exceptional circumstances, wear or damage could
                  occur on the first use of the Goods which would reduce the lifetime of
